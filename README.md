Better Stack count
-
Simple mod which let you customise the item stack count (inventory&hotbar) ~

settings:
-
- size
- font
- colour/ opacity
- position

I always find the item stack count a bit too big for smaller screen which hides the item so :3

I'll also add more versions support like 1.20 or before. Feel free to fork and update/ downgrade this mod.
